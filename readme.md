## This project I call "GraphFix" is my improvement of an existing data visualization regarding the most popular pizza toppings in the U.K.
The original title was "Does pineapple belong on a pizza?"


## In examining the dataset, however, the title is a bit misleading. While a portion of the article references Britons' preference for pineapple, a second pie chart is also included which lists out pizza toppings with a percentage of people in the UK who like that topping on their pizza.  The graphic is very confusing in a pie chart form and chaotic in its nature.  A bar chart would best illustrate the data included within the given data set.

A better title and graphic for this data set would be as follows:
# What is the most popular pizza topping in the U.K.?

Below is the old version (yuck!):
